# OldHoldables
 sticks holdables to your hands oldschool style

WIP! Do not compile, use, share, or redistribute unless you're OK with weird shit happening. Don't say I didn't warn you if things get fucked. There's a reason I haven't provided builds of this.

# Known issues
- The wardrobe doesn't work with OldCosmetics enabled
  - Changing holdables does not work
  - Putting on gloves can set the stored zone back
  - You can probably just put the zones back before the cosmetic changes and then call HoldableToggle(); again afterwards? How would you run code before the cosmetic you're wearing changes though, since the index will no longer match?
- Entering City's cosmetic preview zones can set the stored zone back (?)
